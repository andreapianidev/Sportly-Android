 * This class provides countdown time announcements for even minutes, i.e. the amount of minutes

 *
 * @apiNote Use this announcement type for even minutes, e.g. 10m0s or 8m0s.<p>
 *     Do NOT use it for 1m0s, however, as the plural form of minutes is used and the announcement
 *     might thus be grammatically incorrect depending on the language.
